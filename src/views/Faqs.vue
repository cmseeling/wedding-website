                          This is a celebration of our wedding with our
                          family/friends. We were married in a very small
                          ceremony on August 6, 2020 in our back yard.

                          Yes - For everyone's safety, due to the size of the
                          event, we are asking guests to come only if you are
                          fully vaccinated. If you will not be fully vaccinated
                          by the time of the reception we would love to see you
                          at another time at a smaller gathering.

                          If they are fully vaccinated, yes! We realize some
                          kids will be too young for the vaccine. However
                          because of the size of the event we do want everyone
                          to be vaccinated for everyone's safety so we ask that
                          you do not bring any kids that are not fully
                          vaccinated.

                          pavillion where we will be eating dinner and that we
                          will be using in case of bad weather is an enclosed

                          Casual dress - please dress for the weather! The
                          pavilion is an enclosed building, but it does not have
                          AC, and we are hoping to take advantage of the park.
                          The atmosphere we are going for here is "festive
                          picnic." Shorts/jeans are welcome.

                          We met on OkCupid, which is a dating website. We had
                          coffee at Uncommon Grounds, and then we walked around
                          Lake of the Isles in the pouring rain. After that, we
                          went to get ice cream from Sebastian Joe's.

                            If you are arriving in Terminal 1 (most major
                            airlines), signs that say "ground transportation"
                            and then "light rail" will direct you to a tram that
                            you take to the actual light rail station. The only
                            thing the tram does is go to the light rail station,
                            and it runs every 2 minutes. You can get on the tram
                            on either side of the hall.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            There will be a ticket machine before you go down
                            the last escalator to the actual light rail
                            platform. Ride the light rail south two stops to the
                            American Blvd/34th Ave Station (you want to ride to
                            Mall of America, not Downtown Minneapolis).

                            If you are arriving in Terminal 2 (Southwest, Sun
                            Country, Jetblue, Condor, or Icelandair), signs will
                            direct you to the light rail station directly, no
                            tram needed. Ride the light rail south two stops to
                            the American Blvd/34th Ave Station (you want to ride
                            to Mall of America, not Downtown Minneapolis). It is
                            a very short walk from the station to the hotel.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The light rail runs every 10-15 minutes during the
                            day, but less often later at night.
                          </p>

                            There is also a shuttle the the hotel runs to the
                            airport; my relatives had conflicting reports about
                            how difficult it was to find, but I believe you find
                            it by following signs to ground transportation.

                          Tickets cost $2.50 during weekday rush hour and $2.00
                          during other times. They are good for unlimited

                          rail. Your ticket will be verified if you board a bus,
                          but tickets are only checked by random inspection on
                          the light rail, so don’t worry if no one checks your
                          ticket. You can buy tickets using cash or a credit
                          card at light rail stations; on buses you can use cash
